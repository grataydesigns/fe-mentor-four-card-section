## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - Gatsby is the fast and flexible framework that makes building websites with any CMS, API, or database fun again.

### What I learned

I learned that Gatsby is an easy framework to use to quickly create prototypes. I like the fact that I can use a tech stack I'm already familiar with like React and Sass. Also, in future projects I can add a CMS of choice and try integrations with Shopify or Auth0, for example.

### Continued development

I think to speed up my prototype setup using Gatsby, I will explore creating a Gatsby theme I can use for future projects. The theme will include commonly used components like Seo, Layout, react hooks, and baseline styles.
